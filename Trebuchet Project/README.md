# Trebuchet Project

A project in Classical Mechanics at Carleton College where we modeled a medieval trebuchet with 3 degrees of freedom in Mathematica. Included are:
- the *Treb Mathematica-merged.pdf* is all the Mathematica notebooks merged into a PDF
- the Mathematica notebook *Trebuchet Lagrangian MAIN.nb* is the main code for simulating our trebuchet
- the Mathematic notebook *trebuchet_quadraticdrag.nb* is focused on the quadratic drag associated with the trebuchet projectile
- the final journal article *Trebuchet_Report JCHB.pdf* on the findings of our project. It is at a publishable standard
