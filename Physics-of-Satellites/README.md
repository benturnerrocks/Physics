# Physics-of-Satellites
My physics major senior capstone project was on understanding and explaining the physics of satellites through a written paper and verbal presentation. This repository includes the resources I used to research the concepts. Included are the following:

- a file "main.tex" for the LaTex code that contains the paper
- a PDF *BT COMPS - Satellites.pdf* with the presentation that I used during my talk
- a PDF *Turner_Final_Version_Comps.pdf* of the paper itself
- bibliography files *aip.bst* for BibTeX formatting and *refs.bib* containing all the references.
