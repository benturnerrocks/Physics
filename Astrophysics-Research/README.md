# HPF Etalon Research

My student research with the guidance of Professor Ryan Terrien in the summer of 2021 focused on identifying the <a href="https://hpf.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Habitable Planet Finder (HPF)</a> etalon calibration system's drifts compared to the HPF laser frequency comb (LFC) calibration system, which does not have a drift but is much more expensive. This folder includes:
- a paper *Rotational_Modulation_of_Spectroscopic_Zeeman_Sign.pdf* which I provided feedback on and received co-authorship
- a python notebook *Data_Cleaner.ipynb* in which I individually created data wrangling and cleaning code for HPF etalon and LFC calibration data pipeline files using pandas, numpy, and more.
- a python notebook *Data_Plotter.ipynb* in which I plotted the output files from *Data_Cleaner.ipynb* into plots that compare and contrast the calibration data from differing calibration sources and pipelines, as well as at different sections of the physical sources and different periods.
- a folder *Example Data* containing a few files with example data used during this project. This gives context for some of the code found in *Data_Cleaner.ipynb*
- a poster *BT Etalon Research Poster.pptx* which I presented at <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/research/symposium/" target="_blank">Carleton Undergraduate Research and Internship Symposium</a>

This was my first experience using Python for data analytics and I enjoyed it. It was easy to learn and a potent tool for future analytical projects.
